# Dogs-vs-cats

Here I built a convolutional neural network to classify images of dogs and cats with Keras on Tensorflow backend. I used the dogs-vs-cats dataset available on kaggle to train the network and also built an web application to deploy the pipeline using Flask.
It is deployed here : http://abhimanyudas34.pythonanywhere.com/dogs-vs-cats
